#How it workds: Generate a list of all possible next steps towards goal from current position
#Store children in Priority Queue based on distance to goal, closest first
#Select closest child and repeat until goal is reached or no more cildren

#A* feed in jumble of letters and A* finds the minimal moves to reach goal arrangements of letters
#h(n) is the heuristic path from current node to destination
#g(n) is the path cost from one node to another, so always 2
